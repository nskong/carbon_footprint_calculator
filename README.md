# Basic Carbon FootPrint Calculator

React + Node/Express web application for calculating carbon footprint. Currently has calculations for travel and some sections of housing.


# Usage

Run ```npm build``` to build the project and install necessary dependencies.

I used Mocha to create the tests for the backend. To run the tests, start the server in a terminal window using:

```npm start```

Then run the following command in another terminal window:

```npm test```

To start the website after building, run:

```npm start```

The website will be available on the browser at http://localhost:3001/
